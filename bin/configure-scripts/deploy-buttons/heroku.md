[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bullet-train-co/bullet_train)

Clicking this button will take you to the first step of a process that, when completed, will provision production-grade infrastructure and services for your Bullet Train application which will cost about **$140/month**.

Once that process has completed, be sure to complete the other steps from the [Deploying to Heroku](https://bullettrain.co/docs/heroku) documentation.

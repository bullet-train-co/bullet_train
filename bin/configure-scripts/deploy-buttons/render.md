### Render

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/bullet-train-co/bullet_train)

Clicking this button will take you to the first step of a process that, when completed, will provision production-grade infrastructure for your Bullet Train application which will cost about **$30/month**.

When you're done deploying to Render, you need to go into "Dashboard" > "web", copy the server URL, and then go into "Env Groups" > "settings" and paste the URL into the value for `BASE_URL`.

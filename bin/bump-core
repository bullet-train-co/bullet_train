        - It looks like you're running this script locally.
        - This script was designed to run as part of a GitHub workflow.
        - The workflow will prepare a speically formatted PR that will kick off other workflows when merged.
        - We don't recommend using this script locally to make updates directly to the starter repo.
        -
        - You can run the workflow by going here:
        - https://github.com/bullet-train-co/bullet_train/actions/workflows/version-bump.yml
        -
        - If you really want to run this locally you should make sure you're not on the `main` branch,
        - and then you can pass the `--allow-local` flag to skip this notice and run the script.
        -
        - For example:
        - ./bin/bump-core --allow-local

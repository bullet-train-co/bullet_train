# This setting determines the target height (in pixels) that `app/assets/images/logo/logo.png` will be resized to
# (while maintaining aspect ratio) when being presented in the `box` component header or the header of outgoing emails.
# You may want to play with this setting after replacing the default Bullet Train starter kit logo with something else.
# For example, if your logo is more squarish in aspect ratio, you probably want to increase this. However, remember you
# must `rails restart` the server in order to see this setting take effect locally.

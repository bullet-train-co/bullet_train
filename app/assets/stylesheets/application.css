/* The theme's stylesheet initializes tailwindcss and imports the theme's default styles.

   The $ThemeStylesheet path is evaluated via a postcss resolver, which finds the theme's
   main stylesheet within the theme's gem.
   
   To control the order of the tailwindcss imports further, you can eject the theme's
   stylesheet locally using the following command, which will take precedence.
   > rake bullet_train:themes:light:eject_css

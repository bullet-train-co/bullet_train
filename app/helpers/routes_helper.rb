module RoutesHelper
  # `collection_actions` is automatically super scaffolded to your routes file when creating certain objects.
  # This is helpful to have around when working with shallow routes and complicated model namespacing. We don't use this
  # by default, but sometimes Super Scaffolding will generate routes that use this for `only` and `except` options.

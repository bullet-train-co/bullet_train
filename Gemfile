# OPTIONAL BULLET TRAIN GEMS
# This section lists Ruby gems that we used to include by default. In an effort to

# Microscope adds useful scopes targeting ActiveRecord `boolean`, `date` and `datetime` attributes.

# automatically match column names to database attributes.

# gem "ruby-openai"

# awesome_print allows us to `ap` our objects for a clean presentation of them.
# https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print
# gem "awesome_print"

# xxhash was previously used by the `core` gems in the generation of random colors for user & team icons.
# If you have an existing app and need to preserve the random colors that were previously being generated
# you can do so by including xxhash here. For new apps, or if you don't care about preserving the colors,
# then there's no reason to include it.
# gem "xxhash"

# unicode-emoji is used by one method (strip_emojis) in the `core` repo that we don't seem to use anywhere.
# If you are using that method then you can uncomment this gem.
# gem "unicode-emoji"

# YOUR GEMS
# You can add any Ruby gems you need below. By keeping them separate from our gems above, you'll avoid the likelihood
# that you run into a merge conflict in the future.

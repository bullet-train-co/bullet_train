# Untitled Application

## Getting Started

1. You must have the following dependencies installed:

     - Ruby 3
          - See [`.ruby-version`](.ruby-version) for the specific version.
     - Node 19
          - See [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) for the specific version.
     - PostgreSQL 14
     - Redis 6.2
     - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome) (for headless browser tests)

    If you don't have these installed, you can use [rails.new](https://rails.new) to help with the process.

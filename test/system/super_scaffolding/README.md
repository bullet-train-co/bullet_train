# About Super Scaffolding Tests

These tests each require some super scaffolding commands to be run _before_ running the tests.

Each subdirectory below contains a `setup.rb` file that you can run to generate the necessary scaffolding.

After running the tests you can run `teardown.rb` from the same directory to remove the super scaffolded code.

**NOTE** We highly reocmmend that you start with a clean git workspace. The super scaffolding commands generate
a lot of files and the cleanup process is... let's call it "brute force". If you have uncommitted changes in
your repo before running `setup.rb` they're likely to get clobbered when you run `teardown.rb`

### Example

To run the `insight` test, you'd run these commands from the main project directory.

First run the `setup.rb` script to generate the scaffolding and run migrations.

```
$ ./test/system/super_scaffolding/insight/setup.rb
Generating Insight model with 'bin/rails generate model Insight team:references name:string description:text'

Writing './app/controllers/account/insights_controller.rb'.
Fixing Standard Ruby on './app/controllers/account/insights_controller.rb'.
Writing './app/views/account/insights/index.html.erb'.
Writing './app/views/account/insights/_menu_item.html.erb'.

Then run the test:

```
$ rails test test/system/super_scaffolding/insight/

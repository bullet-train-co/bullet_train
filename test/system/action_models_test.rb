  # you'll see why toward the end when you're trying to clean up the files
  # created (and then afterwards tested in the test below.)
  #
  # before this test can be run, we need to do the following setup on the console:
  #   bundle exec test/bin/setup-action-models-system-test
  #
  # to run this test:
  #   rails test test/system/action_models_test.rb
  #
  # after the test you can tear down what we've done here in the db:
  #   rake db:migrate VERSION=`ls db/migrate | sort | tail -n 9 | head -n 1`
  #   git checkout .
  #   git clean -d -f

  # force autoload.
